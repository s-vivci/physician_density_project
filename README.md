# physician_density_project
## Final class project exploring relation between physician density and global development indicators

Global health and economic indicators provide valuable insights into the relationships between healthcare access, professional medical services, and economic development across countries. Understanding these relationships is crucial for shaping public health policies and resource allocation strategies, especially in an increasingly interconnected world.

This project aims to merge and analyze three datasets from leading international organizations to explore the intersections of healthcare coverage, medical workforce density, and economic indicators. Specifically, the datasets include:

OECD Healthcare Coverage Data: This dataset provides information on the proportion of populations covered under healthcare systems across multiple countries. https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?fs[0]=Topic%2C1%7CHealth%23HEA%23%7CHealthcare%20coverage%23HEA_COV%23&pg=0&fc=Topic&bp=true&snb=1&vw=tb&df[ds]=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&df[id]=DSD_HEALTH_PROT%40DF_HEALTH_PROT&df[ag]=OECD.ELS.HD&df[vs]=1.0&dq=.A..PT_POP.COVGCMED%2BTPRIBASI&pd=2015%2C2017&to[TIME_PERIOD]=false

WHO Physician Density Data: This dataset offers a measure of the number of physicians available per 10,000 people in various countries. https://data.who.int/indicators/i/CCCEBB2/217795A

World Bank Global Data: This dataset includes economic and healthcare indicators such as GDP per capita and the proportion of births attended by skilled health professionals. https://databank.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD/1ff4a498/Popular-Indicators#

By combining these datasets, the analysis seeks to uncover meaningful trends and relationships that can inform policy discussions. For instance, the study may reveal how economic prosperity correlates with healthcare coverage or whether the availability of skilled healthcare providers aligns with positive health outcomes such as higher birth attendance rates.
